## Fig03
Evaluation of the CAMSRA aerosol properties database versus AERONET aerosol products in Germany in the period from 2003 to 2019. Left side panels show the deviation of an quantity (CAMSRA - AERONET) on left y-axis as 2d-histogram and the mean as black line. The values on the left side panels are plotted versus quantiles (number of standard deviations $\sigma$ from median) of the AERONET distribution. The right side panels show the dataset distribution of each quantity and calculated evaluation metrics.

In addition the "for_2015" plot shows the same figure, but exclusively for 2015 data.

## Fig04
REari relative kernel calculated for perturbations of 1% of different variables in the ecRad radiation scheme. The calculations are conducted for surface (blue) and top of atmosphere (orange).

## Fig05
REari mean bias (panel (a)) and daily RMSE (panel (b)) calculated from REari kernels weighted by MBE and RMSE from the evaluation of the CAMSRA aerosol properties dataset versus AERONET aerosol products. The calculations are conducted for surface (blue) and top of atmosphere (orange).

## Fig06
Annual mean of REari MBE and RMSE of T-CARS over the region of Germany. The RMSE is calculated for daily average values of REari at surface (SFC), top of atmosphere (TOA) and for the total atmosphere (ATM).

## Fig07
Comparison of AERONET and T-CARS REari daily average products at SFC and TOA for the period of 2003 to 2019. The metrics are calculated using the AERONET data as reference.

In addition, the figure "for_2015" show the same comparison for the year 2015. 

## Fig08
Annual mean of aerosol properties at surface over Germany. The calculation is conducted within the framework of T-CARS.

## Fig09
Seasonal mean of mass extinction coefficient, single scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry parameter (G) (a)-(c) of the aerosol mixture (d)-(g) and (h)-(k) from the CAMSRA aerosol properties database over Germany 2015. The aerosol mixture pie charts show the column integrated mass fraction of each aerosol classification (d)-(g) and the contribution to the extinction by fraction of AOD at 550\,\unit{nm} (h)-(k) (SS - sea salt; DU - mineral dust; OM - organic matter; BC - black carbon; SU - ammonium sulphate).

## Fig10
Annual mean of surface clear sky irradiance (a), (b) and irradiance reduction due to aerosols (c), (d) over Germany. The calculation is conducted within the framework of T-CARS.

## Fig11
Annual mean REari at the surface (SFC), TOA and total atmosphere (ATM) over Germany. The simulation is conducted within the framework of T-CARS.

## Fig12
The 30 day rolling mean of REari at the surface (SFC), top of atmosphere (TOA) and total atmosphere (ATM) of the year 2015 simulated with T-CARS over Germany. The RMSE estimated from radiative kernel analysis is shown as shaded area for daily average REari values.

## Fig13
Annual overview of average AOD over all DWD measurement stations calculated with T-CARS and from CSF with different CSM. AOD values are shown as 30-day rolling mean. For T-CARS the 30-day standard deviation is shown as grey area.

## Fig14
The 30 days rolling mean of REari in the year 2015 utilizing different approaches. REari simulated with T-CARS is presented by the median over the full German region (black line) together with the standard deviation (grey area). REari calculated from observations and different CSM is computed as the mean over all DWD stations, while cloudy days are linearly interpolated over the year.

## Fig15
The REari calculated from different CSM as average over all DWD observation stations is compared to the T-CARS simulation. The annual variability is indicated by the SD ($\sigma$) of the individual dataset. The performance of the individual CSM is displayed by the SD of REari difference and correlation versus T-CARS.

## Fig16
The REari calculated at different DWD observation stations as average over all CSM is compared to the T-CARS simulation. The annual variability is indicated by the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the individual dataset. The performance of REari calculated at an station is displayed by the SD of REari difference and correlation versus T-CARS. The amount of days with an successful clear sky fit are displayed in brackets in front of the station name in the legend.

## FigA1
Comparison of AOD provided by CAMS\,RA and calculated with T-CARS from CAMS\,RA model level aerosol mass mixing ratio. The data is acquired in the period from 2003 to 2019 for Germany. (Here the data is shown for 2015 only)

## FigA2
REari kernels weighted by uncertainty estimates of AOD, AE, SSA and G from the AERONET direct and inversion products. The calculations are conducted for surface (blue) and top of atmosphere (orange).
